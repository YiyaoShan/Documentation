title: Becoming a Document Consumer
---

Does your enterprise receive a large number of documents in your e-Box? Is it difficult for you to process messages manually in your e-Box online? Technical integration with e-Box via a technical interface (web service) can be a solution, enabling messages to be retrieved in "packages" ("Document Consumer" solution).
All your e-Box messages can then be retrieved directly from your internal IT system. This enables you to manage message distribution within your enterprise. You can also automate certain actions. Attention, the onboarding as a Document Consumer is irreversible.
